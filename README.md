# ICLR 2024 Explorer

I wanted to filter the ICLR 2024 papers based on the reviews and the metrics
received, so I made this simple app to do just that.

A simple vuejs hosted on netfliy:
[aquamarine-cocada-c77c38.netlify.app](aquamarine-cocada-c77c38.netlify.app)

The data is fetched via the openreview's python API, then it is parsed to be
concise and smaller in size (this is also done via a python script).

The whole thing fetch, parse and interface, and hosting took a few hours, so
please don't expect any testing or such things.
